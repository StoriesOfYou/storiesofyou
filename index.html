    <h2>What is Stories of You?</h2>
    <p>Stories of You is an idea for a service that makes it easy for anyone to record their stories as responses to questions or photos. We'll bring those recorded stories and content together in meaningful audio and video packages that can be kept for life. Everyone's stories deserve to be told, and Stories of You wants to make the telling and safekeeping of those stories easy.</p>

  <h2>Why Stories Matter</h2>
  <p>We believe everyone has a story worth sharing. Watch this short message about how capturing family memories‚Äîjust like my grandfather once did‚Äîcan help bring people closer together.</p>
